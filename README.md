# AI Model Logical Question Testing Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a curated set of logical, mathematical, and reasoning-based questions designed to evaluate the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of AI language models (LLMs). These questions span a variety of topics including logical puzzles, numerical comparisons, calculations, and general knowledge. The goal is to provide a standardized set of challenges for testing and benchmarking AI models.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Assess the reasoning accuracy of AI LLMs.
- Identify strengths and weaknesses in logical and mathematical understanding.
- Share a structured set of test cases with the community for reproducible evaluation.

## Question Categories
### Logical Reasoning
- How many months have 28 days?
- Which is greater: the square root of 16 or the cube root of 27?
- If a man boils 2 eggs in 1 minute, how much time will it take to boil 10 eggs?

### Mathematical Comparisons
- Which number is greater: 9.9 or 9.11?
- Which number is greater: 3.14 or π?

### General Knowledge
- Name a country whose name ends with 'lia' and tell me its capital city.
- What is the capital of France?
- What is the largest planet in our solar system?

### Calculations
- Solve this question: 8 + (6 × 2) − (3 + 5) ÷ 4
- If a car travels 60 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 2 hours?

### Time and Geometry
- If a clock shows 3:15, what is the angle between the hour hand and minute hand?

### Fun and Trivia
- How many r's are in "strawberry"?
- What number rhymes with the word used to describe a tall plant?
- How many letters are there in the word "Mississippi"?

### Space and Exploration
- Which mission was launched to explore the outer planets and study planetary atmospheres, moons, and interstellar space?
- What is the speed of Voyager 1?
- What is the speed of Voyager 2?

### Astronomy
- How many galaxies are there in the universe?

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-model-testing.git
   ```
2. Use these questions to prompt AI models and record their responses.
3. Analyze the responses to evaluate the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of the models.
